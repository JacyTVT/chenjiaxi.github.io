*  the degree of **within-group agreement** of scores from the lower level units or attributes potentially could be conceptualized as a focal construct as opposed to merely **a statistical prerequisite for aggregation.**
 * instead of treating withingroup variance as error variance (which is what consensus models do), **within-group variance** (i.e., the within-group dispersion of scores) could serve as** an operationalization of a focal construct.**
## Functional relationships:
Meaning of higher level construct is in the dispersion or variance among lower level units
*  the essence of dispersion composition is in specifying the nature of the higher level construct represented by dispersion along some lower-level variable
 
## Typical operational combination
Within-group variance (or its derivative) as operationalization of the higher level construct
##  Statistical prerequisite
Absence of** multimodality** in the within-group distributions of lower level scores
* A β change occurs when there is a change in the subjective metric, resulting in a recalibration of the measuring instrument given a constant conceptual domain.
* A γ change occurs when there is a shift in the meaning or conceptualization of the construct being measured. 

**bias from the reality**

## Example from climate research
In our climate example, the researcher may propose the construct of climate strength conceptualized as the degree of within-group consensus of climate perceptions and index the construct using within-group variance or some dispersion measure of individual climate responses. The dispersion measure then is correlated with the measure of organizational performance to test the researcher's hypothesis that organizational climate strength is associated positively with organizational performance.
