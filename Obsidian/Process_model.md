[[Typology of Composition Models]]
## Functional relationships:
Process parameters at higher level are analogues of process parameters at lower level

> Process composition models are concerned with composing some process or mechanism from the lower level of conceptualization to the higher level.
 > In process composition, functional relationships for parameters at different levels are **analogous relationships**, and functional relationships for parameter *interrelationships *at different levels are **homologous relationships**.
 
 In short, critical parameters of the integration process at the individual level have higher level analogues that constitute the critical process parameters at the organizational level.
 
## Typical operational combination
No simple algorithm; ensure analogues exist for all critical parameters
#### Process:
1. In these models, a process or mechanism is first specified at the lower level explicating the essential or critical parameters and their interrelationships.
2. The process then is composed to the higher level by identifying critical higher level parameters, which are higher level analogues of the lower level parameters, and describing interrelationships among higher level parameters, which are homologous to the lower level parameter relationships.
