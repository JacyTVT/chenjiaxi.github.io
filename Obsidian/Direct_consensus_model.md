## Functional relationships
Meaning of higher level construct is in the consensus among lower level units
> This model uses **within-group consensus** of the lower level units as the functional relationship to specify how the construct conceptualized and operationalized at the lower level is functionally** isomorphic to** another form of the construct at ** the higher level**
## Typical operational combination
**Within-group agreement** to index consensus and justify aggregation
This operational combination process has two components:
1. The first component includes an operationalization (i.e., a measure) of the conceptual definition for each of the two constructs (i.e., one at each level).
2.  The second component specifies the manner of and **precondition(s)** *with-in group agreement* for combining the individual lower level measurements to represent the higher level measurement. 

<u>**The conceptual relationship between the two forms of the construct at different levels then drives the manner in which the lower level construct composes to the higher level construct.**</u>

## Example from climate research
researcher would proceed to check within-group agreement (group here refers to the organization) of individual climate responses using some agreement index (e.g., rn,s). High within-group agreement indicates consensus and justifies aggregation of individual climate responses to represent scores on the organizational climate variable. 

## Shortcoming
*  the use of within-group agreement as a valid justification for aggregation is independent of variability between the higher level units.
*  betweengroup variability may be more important in construct validation of the aggregated


> the absence of between-group variability indicates that hypothesized differences at the group level do not exist


> it is more appropriate to aggregate the individual-level data to the organizational than departmental level, and it provides construct validity evidence for organizational climate but not departmental climate.
