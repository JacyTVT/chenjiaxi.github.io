[[Typology of Composition Models]]
**[[Consensus Models]]**
## Referent-shift consensus vs [[Direct consensus model]]
 **Similarity:**  The within-group agreement of lower level attributes, is used to compose the lower level construct to the higher level construct.
** Difference:** 
1. In referent-shift consensus composition, the lower level attributes being assessed for consensus are conceptually distinct though derived from the original individual-level construct.
2. That is, there is a shift in the referent prior to consensus assessment, and it is the new referent that is actually being combined to represent the higher level construct.

## Functional relationships
Lower level units being composed by consensus are conceptually distinct though derived from the original individual-level units

## Typical operational combination
Within-group agreement of new referent lower level units to index consensus and justify aggregation

#### Process
1. First, the researcher begins with a conceptual definition and operationalization of the focal construct at the lower level.
2. While maintaining the basic content of the construct, the researcher then derives a new form of the construct at the same level by shifting the referent of the basic content.
3. The new form of the construct then is aggregated to the higher level construct based on within-group consensus.
