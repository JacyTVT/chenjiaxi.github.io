## Functional relationships
Higher level unit is a summation of the lower level units regardless of the variance among these units.

>the variance of the lower level units is of no theoretical or operational concern for composing the lower level construct to the higher level construct

## Typical operational combination
Summing or averaging lower level scores

## Example from climate research
* all organizations have an organizational climate that can be described as high or low on various dimensions regardless of the level of within-organization individual-level agreement.
* within-organization agreement is an issue of measurement accuracy reflecting individual-level random error and sources of bias.
* using an additive composition model, the researcher averages the climate perceptions of individuals within each organization, regardless of the within-organization variance, to represent the organizational climate variable.
